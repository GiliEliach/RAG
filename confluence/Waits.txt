Waits
Verisoft framework uses Seleniumâ€™s Explicitly Wait mechanism.
The use of wait merely simplifies the need to call a new WebDriverWait object:
There is also the option of just waiting, without the need to try and catch an exception:
 
1Waits.visibilityOf(driver, timeOut, navigate);
1Waits.milliseconds(3000);
