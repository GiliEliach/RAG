About VerisoftDriver
VerisoftDriver is a wrapper for the WebDriver interface. You can investigate more in the VeriSoftDriver Javadoc. It implements the WebDriver 
interface, as well as a few other Selenium interfaces:   JavascriptExecutor, HasCapabilities, HasVirtualAuthenticator, 
Interactive, PrintsPage, TakesScreenshot, and WrapsDriver.
VerisoftDriver is also a superclass for the VerisoftMobileDriver
In its essence, the VerisoftDriver serves as a thin wrapper, which provides verbose logging for the WebDriver activity and allows its user to 
perform the following tasks:
a. Define and execute async operations
b. Add custom listeners using the WebDriverListener mechanism
Note! In the Verisoft roadmap the VerisoftDriver object will be replaced by the Selenium 4 Decoration mechanism.
