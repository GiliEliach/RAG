Test Results Calculation
JUnit 5, like a lot of other unit test frameworks, works in the following way:
1. If during the test there were no exceptions thrown, or exceptions that were thrown were caught and handled - the test is declared as 
PASSED
2. If during the test there were exceptions thrown, which were not caught or dealt with - the test is declared FAILED
3. There is a third option, which declares the test as SKIPPED
Once this concept is understood, we realize that assertions, if do not meet the criteria, throw an exception under the hood thus making the 
test fail. 
Verisoft Framework uses a publisher (aka subject) to report the test result. It evaluates the test result using the JUnit 5 test result 
mechanism and then reports the result to its observers. So, for ExtentsReport for example, it will NOT report an error during the test 
execution, since it automatically causes the Extent Test to fail, and the publisher waits until JUnit 5 will resolve the test execution result. 
Using Assumptions.assumeTrue(boolean) Will help users to skip tests. You can see an example here
