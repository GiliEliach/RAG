How to use Extent-Report for reporting
The most basic and common report mechanism the Verisoft framework provides is the Extent Report module.
The module is a free-to-use module. For convenience, the framework does not rely on external CSS configuration and applies generated 
built-in CSS files.
In order to use the report, simply annotate @ExtentReport above the class.
Thatâ€™s it! Start writing to the report using the Report object. 
At the end of the execution, a folder named Target will be created. It will hold, among other stuff, the following folder structure:
The spark folder holds the CSS files, and the TestReport.html is the actual report:
In order to change the test name (on the left) to a meaningful name (not the method name) simply use the @DisplayName annotation 
like this:  @DisplayName ("My meaningful Test Name")
In order to change the test description:
simply use the @Description("This test has a description")annotation.
So, in the end, you will have something that looks like this:
 
 
 
 
1@Test
2@DisplayName ("My meaningful Test Name" )
3@Description ("This test has a deescription" )
4public void someTestName (VerisoftDriver  driver){
5    Report.info("Some Report Data" );
6    Asserts.assertTrue (false, "Should fail" )
